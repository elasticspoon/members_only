Members Only

The goal is to build a basic blog website with user authentication that affects what users see based on
if they are logged in or not.

The project has turned into more of a reddit type site where users make accounts to be able to post and comment.
Non-users get "adds" while users do not.
Users are able to make posts and comment on other posts and comments.

Non-users cannot see the details of users but can see the text of comments and post.
